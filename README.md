Synchronization

• At times, you may find that more that one thread access the same set
of data.

• For example, in a banking application, a thread may be responsible
for updating the account balance while the other thread may be
responsible for displaying the total account balance.

• In such a situation, the thread execution needs to be coordinated or
synchronized to avoid inconsistency and deadlock.
